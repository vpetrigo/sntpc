# Simple Rust SNTP client

-------------------------

This crate provides a method for sending requests to NTP servers and process responses,
extracting received timestamp.

Supported SNTP protocol versions:

- [SNTPv4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4330)

### Documentation

-----------------

More information about this crate can be found in the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/sntpc)

### Usage example

- dependency for the app

```toml
[dependencies]
sntpc = { version = "0.6", features = ["sync"] }
```

- application code

```rust
use sntpc::{sync::get_time, NtpContext, StdTimestampGen};

use std::net::{SocketAddr, ToSocketAddrs, UdpSocket};
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

#[allow(dead_code)]
const POOL_NTP_ADDR: &str = "pool.ntp.org:123";
#[allow(dead_code)]
const GOOGLE_NTP_ADDR: &str = "time.google.com:123";

fn main() {
    #[cfg(feature = "log")]
    if cfg!(debug_assertions) {
        simple_logger::init_with_level(log::Level::Trace).unwrap();
    } else {
        simple_logger::init_with_level(log::Level::Info).unwrap();
    }

    let socket =
        UdpSocket::bind("0.0.0.0:0").expect("Unable to crate UDP socket");
    socket
        .set_read_timeout(Some(Duration::from_secs(2)))
        .expect("Unable to set UDP socket read timeout");

    for addr in POOL_NTP_ADDR.to_socket_addrs().unwrap() {
        let ntp_context = NtpContext::new(StdTimestampGen::default());
        let result = get_time(addr, &socket, ntp_context);

        match result {
            Ok(time) => {
                assert_ne!(time.sec(), 0);
                let seconds = time.sec();
                let microseconds = u64::from(time.sec_fraction()) * 1_000_000
                    / u64::from(u32::MAX);
                println!("Got time from [{POOL_NTP_ADDR}] {addr}: {seconds}.{microseconds}");

                break;
            }
            Err(err) => println!("Err: {err:?}"),
        }

        thread::sleep(Duration::new(2, 0));
    }
}
```

You can find this [example](examples/simple-request) as well as other example projects in the
[example directory](examples).

## `no_std` support

-------------------

There is an example available on how to use [`smoltcp`](examples/smoltcp-request) stack and that should provide
general idea on how to bootstrap `no_std` networking and timestamping tools for `sntpc` library usage

## `async` support

-------------------

Starting version `0.5` the default interface is `async`. If you want to use synchronous interface, read about `sync`
feature below.

`tokio` example: [`examples/tokio`](examples/tokio)

There is also `no_std` support with feature `async`, but it requires Rust >= `1.75-nightly` version.
The example can be found in [separate repository](https://github.com/vpikulik/sntpc_embassy).

## `sync` support

-------------------

`sntpc` crate is `async` by default, since most of the frameworks (I have seen) for embedded systems utilize
asynchronous approach, e.g.:

- [RTIC](https://github.com/rtic-rs/rtic)
- [embassy](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy)

If you need fully synchronous interface it is available in the `sntpc::sync` submodule and respective `sync`-feature
enabled. In the case someone needs a synchronous socket support the currently async `NtpUdpSocket` trait can be
implemented in a fully synchronous manner. This is an example for the `std::net::UdpSocket` that is available in the
crate:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "std")]
impl NtpUdpSocket for UdpSocket {
    async fn send_to(&self, buf: &[u8], addr: SocketAddr) -> Result<usize> {
        match self.send_to(buf, addr) {
            Ok(usize) => Ok(usize),
            Err(_) => Err(Error::Network),
        }
    }

    async fn recv_from(&self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> Result<(usize, SocketAddr)> {
        match self.recv_from(buf) {
            Ok((size, addr)) => Ok((size, addr)),
            Err(_) => Err(Error::Network),
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, you may implement everything as synchronous, `sntpc` synchronous interface handles `async`-like stuff
internally.

That approach also allows to avoid issues with [`maybe_async`](https://docs.rs/maybe-async/latest/maybe_async/) when the
sync/async feature [violates Cargo requirements](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html):
> That is, enabling a feature should not disable functionality, and it should usually be safe to enable any combination
> of features.

Small overhead introduced by creating an executor should be negligible.

effort is wasted. If there's already an open issue for it, knock yourself out. See the
