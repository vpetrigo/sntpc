# How to contribute

This project started as a little excuse to exercise some of the Rust features. To make it as easy as possible for you to
contribute and for me to keep an overview, here are a few guidelines which should help us avoid all kinds of unnecessary
work or disappointment. And of course, this document is subject to discussion, so please
[create an issue](https://github.com/vpetrigo/sntpc/issues) or a pull request if you find a way to improve it!
